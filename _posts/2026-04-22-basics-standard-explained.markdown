# BASICS

Business Assistance System

[BASICS](https://github.com/babbworks/basics-standard) is a practical standard for building business tools that can operate across unstable conditions, constrained devices, mixed operator skill levels, and long product lifecycles.

It is not a branding layer and not optional philosophy.
It is a commitments framework with testable obligations.

Just as BASIC expanded access to programming, BASICS expands access to business system building.

## Why BASICS Exists

Most tool stacks optimize for stable broadband, modern hardware, large teams, and homogeneous deployment environments.
Real operations frequently look different:

- intermittent connectivity
- low-cost and low-capacity devices
- mixed digital and paper workflows
- fragmented software vendors and incompatible interfaces
- teams that need speed without sacrificing data durability

Without a shared standard, teams repeatedly solve the same problems in incompatible ways.
The result is integration drag, brittle migrations, and operator lock-in.

BASICS addresses this by defining a common contract for command surfaces, records, interoperability, resilience, and lifecycle governance.

## What BASICS Is

BASICS is:

- a cross-tool contract for command, event, and record behavior
- a conformance model with progressive tiers
- a profile system spanning software, hardware, and firmware
- a governance process for controlled evolution
- a durability strategy for long-lived interoperability

BASICS is not:

- a single product
- a mandate for one programming language
- a stylistic UI framework
- a centralized cloud dependency

## Core Argument

The strongest argument for BASICS is operational continuity.

Organizations do not fail because they lack features; they fail when core records, commands, and workflows become unreliable, opaque, or non-portable across changing constraints.
BASICS prioritizes continuity by requiring:

- explicit and stable command semantics
- local-first record mutation paths
- interoperable schema evolution rules
- conformance evidence instead of claims
- long-lived references for deviations and policy decisions

This makes BASICS valuable for both small tools and industrial systems.

## Mission

BASICS helps teams build interoperable tools that preserve operator command and control, remain legible, and operate in constrained environments.

## Organizing Principles

- Command and control belongs to the operator.
- Default network of one.
- Interoperability accelerates innovation.
- Device-constrained deployment is foundational.
- Open governance with proposal and community review.

## Architecture Model

BASICS uses a layered architecture so products can implement only what they need while remaining compatible.

1. Shared Core
   - universal rule set for commands, records, interoperability, versioning, governance, and evidence
2. Software Profile
   - local-first mutation, sync/conflict handling, secure SDLC, supply-chain transparency
3. Hardware Profile
   - manufacturing lifecycle controls, testability, serviceability, device capability declarations
4. Firmware Profile
   - secure updates, trust-role separation, recovery guarantees, firmware provenance
5. Operational Extensions
   - optional modules and tool-specific behavior registered through formal deviation and conformance pathways

## Conformance Architecture

Conformance is intentional and progressive.

### Tiers

- Core
  - baseline command contract, local record operations, and interoperability declarations
- Field
  - constrained/degraded behavior evidence and conflict/sync reliability proof
- Industrial
  - security lifecycle rigor and publishable conformance evidence reviewed by Babb and partner where delegated

### Scoring Model

- mandatory requirements are pass/fail
- optional controls use maturity scoring

This enables strict minimum guarantees while still rewarding gradual hardening.

## Governance Architecture

BASICS governance balances speed and stability.

- proposal + community review
- targeted 100-day lifecycle from draft to ratification decision
- trial implementation before mandatory adoption where appropriate
- published migration impact for accepted changes
- requirement sunset only with overlap and explicit replacement path

This keeps the standard adaptive without destabilizing implementers.

## Interoperability Architecture

BASICS treats interoperability as an engineering system, not a vague aspiration.

- command classes are normalized
- event and schema contracts are versioned
- additive evolution is default
- unknown non-critical extensions are safely ignored
- unknown critical extensions fail clearly and safely
- extension points are exercised in tests to prevent protocol ossification

The result is compatibility that can evolve without freezing.

## Trust and Evidence Architecture

Claims are not enough.
BASICS requires machine-checkable and human-auditable evidence:

- command and schema specs
- ADR history
- degraded-mode matrix
- tier test outputs
- SBOM/provenance where profile requires it
- registered deviations with durable identifiers and long-lived links

This turns compliance from narrative into verifiable state.

## Why This Should Last

BASICS is built around durable design choices:

- explicit command semantics
- local-first continuity for core records
- profile-based expansion rather than monolithic scope
- stable rule IDs and citation-backed policy lineage
- backward compatibility orientation down to the simplest supported profile

The goal is not to lock the ecosystem in place.
The goal is to let it evolve without breaking the operational spine.

## Reference Implementation Direction

`workpads` is the current proof product for hardening BASICS in practice.
It is the first place where rule clarity, conformance mechanics, and profile boundaries should be stress-tested and improved.

## Standards Set v0.1.1

- [Shared Core Standard](standards/shared-core.md)
- [Software Profile](standards/software-profile.md)
- [Hardware Profile](standards/hardware-profile.md)
- [Firmware Profile](standards/firmware-profile.md)
- [Deviation Registry](standards/deviation-registry.md)
- [Conformance Checklist](standards/conformance-checklist.md)
- [Rule Index](standards/rule-index.md)
- [Adoption Playbook](ADOPTION.md)

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with [Shared Core Standard](standards/shared-core.md).
2. Apply profile documents that match your system footprint.
3. Review [Rule Index](standards/rule-index.md) for implementation mapping.
4. Use [Conformance Checklist](standards/conformance-checklist.md) for assessment.
5. Register deviations in [Deviation Registry](standards/deviation-registry.md) when needed.

## External Guidance Baseline

BASICS rules are grounded in established guidance families, including:

- ISO/IEC quality and architecture standards
- IETF protocol extensibility and lifecycle guidance
- NIST secure development and resilience frameworks
- SBOM and supply-chain provenance practices
- constrained/offline architecture guidance for real-world deployment conditions

## Status

This repository is in active drafting.
v0.1.1 establishes stable rule identifiers, profile boundaries, and citation-backed obligations.
Future revisions will continue through proposal, trial, and review cycles.
