Our quest continues! We’re committed to forging new weapons for Working Heroes based on information and insights which they alone possess. How do they fight their daily battles? What is the rhythm of their day? And what could their tools do better in order to improve their performance and free their time? These new tools are new technologies, combining software and hardware in a stronger, longer-lasting fusion of code and carbon. We’re leaving behind today’s Valley of countless apps and subscriptions which beleaguere our Heroes. The tools are too many, and they split up attention while depleting energy and income. The full array of subscription tools that are needed to fully administer a small enterprise are too costly for most independent operators, require too much training, and they ways in which these tools tie together are beyond their abilities.

When down in the heart of this Valley, its immensity and awesomeness can lull us into believing it’s all there is. Its atmosphere and conditions become the norm and it’s hard to imagine a different kind of operating environment. But just ahead lies the Plateau. A stabler environment where different tools and habits are needed for survival. The Plateau doesn’t replace the Valley, it thrives because of its life and vitality. But nonetheless the Plateau has a life of its own. It’s where Working Heroes operate and build their dreams.
