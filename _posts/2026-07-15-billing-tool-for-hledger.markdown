THis is the readme for the consulting tool I made. It works with hledger and supports tracking time per project and per entity, in case you have multiple business names that you bill under. It generates a PDF with "consult invoice" using a built in template. Using 'typst' you can easily add more templates as well.

# consult

A command-line billing system for consultants built around [hledger](https://hledger.org). Log time, generate invoices as PDFs, and keep your books in plain text.

## What it does

- Interactive time logging with per-entry rate, tax, type, and tags
- Invoice generation: produces both a PDF (via Typst) and an hledger journal entry
- Payment tracking with aging reports
- Multi-entity support (bill through different companies)
- Rate history per project (rate changes are tracked by date)
- Automatic `include` management for your hledger journal

## Requirements

| Tool | Minimum version | Install |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Python | 3.8+ | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or system package manager |
| PyYAML | 5.0+ | `pip install pyyaml` |
| hledger | 1.29+ | [hledger.org/install](https://hledger.org/install.html) |
| Typst | 0.11+ | [typst.app](https://github.com/typst/typst/releases) or `cargo install typst-cli` |

Verify your setup:

```bash
python3 --version        # Python 3.8+
python3 -c "import yaml" # no error = PyYAML installed
hledger --version        # hledger 1.29+
typst --version          # typst 0.11+
```

### Platform notes

- **Linux**: All tools available via package managers or direct download

## How it fits with hledger

Your main hledger journal stays yours — household expenses, income, whatever you track. This tool generates `.journal` files that your main file pulls in via `include`:

```
include ~/path/to/hledger-billing/invoices/2026/*.journal
```

The tool manages this automatically on first invoice generation.
