What has potential? What is practical to pursue? What is possible? What additional effots will unlock these opportunities? What conditions will create success? What is audacious but attainable? What is worth self dying for and what living passionately for? WHat is setting now and what is arising and what does positioning look like? What wilderness is interesting and what are the voices needed for the era ahead? How best to integrate efforts and create the foundations for alot of family fun?

We are returning to an era where hardware determines compute but on new terms. Whereas the early days were marked by packing transistors to shrink operations, the new explosion of pervasive compute is about matching processes with the right product. Just at this moment when computers are dematerializing knowledge work they are beginning to materialize or cause to exist countless more machines and smart devices that will be transforming the appearance, culture and operations of earth, the moon and beyond.

As upheaval comes to every industry, as it cyclically has in history, there are times when man must pause and inquire what work is worth pursuing now? And given the new conditions for society, what kinds of pursuits have become newly possible? Comparative advantage? Invisible opportunities? If the puck is moving as fast as many say it is then we should honestly view our early pursuits as a company or as an expert as simply bridges through to the higher sustained orbit which we sense is reachable but also necessary for survival. Orbit or obsolete.

It is not specific jobs or industries which are now setting, it is a whole broad set of civilizational assumptions which are being overturned, sifted, and re-stated all at the same time. A highly ancient and astoundingly novel environment for human life seems to be emerging where emphasis will be on the fundamental building blocks of existence, from the rural village up through to lunar landscapes.

Coupled with the need to keep living is our renewed need to keep producing and also creating novel solutions to the insatiable impulse to produce. Solutions which can extend and expand opportunities for living in old and new places. The arm became augmented by the windmill, by steam, coal and then by our system of wires. Now, as the coal empires find new footing, AI is empowering vast new possibilities for society and industry. Democratized expertise is enabling millions of minds to channel wind at the sails adding to the directs that everything is taking. 

The goods and services needed for life and work in all there aspects are if anything exploding. Meanwhile the leveers to directly influence and intervene in the new great experiment, though seemingly countless, are but few in number when looked at from a physical standpoint. The opportunity for Babb and new companies like it centers on a simple level poorly understood by the public but of foremost priority to today's engineer, the microcontroller or in common terms as it will surely be forever known, the microcomputer.
