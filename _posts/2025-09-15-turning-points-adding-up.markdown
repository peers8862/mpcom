I’ve had a few turning points in my lifetime. By sharing my stories a bit more, I pray that it helps others to recall and share where they’ve been and what they’ve seen. I think in some ways life’s journey comes down to hopes lost and hopes regained. It reads in 1st Peter 3:15 ““but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:”. I’m ready to give answers for anyone interested and most stem from my own experiences. It’s been a bumpy road at times but I think our trials and fortunes raise within each of us most of the same kinds of questions. The answers we stitch together make us unique though. We might have similar summaries but it’s the stitching and weaving we do that makes all of us a special God-assigned narrator like no other.
