I started this blog to share things I'm learning, especially about business and leadership. I am also sharing stories about the growth and character of places.

In 2018, I became determined to become a life-long student of small business, of startups, and the technologies and tools that help them operate and compete. Despite my best intentions, I made many classic and predictable errors as an independent operator and aspiring startup founder. In 2023 I took better stock of my experiences and started my journey again with an apple a day. Then I started the creation of Babb, a company dedicated to helping individuals lead and learn in business.
